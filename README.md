# Seedling Sorter ðŸŒ±
### About
Seedling Sorter is a model that can classify images of 12 types of seedlings (small plants) with 79% accuracy. The API and Streamlit application are not deployed yet, but the code is available should you wish to implement your own local app.
<br/>The project uses the VS Plant Seedlings Dataset available [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/vbookshelf/v2-plant-seedlings-dataset).
